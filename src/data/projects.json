      "overview": "GandaBERT is a groundbreaking NLP project that brings modern language understanding to Luganda, one of Uganda's major languages. This project addresses the critical gap in NLP tools for African languages.",
      "challenge": "Luganda is a low-resource language with limited NLP datasets and tools. Creating accurate text classification required building datasets from scratch and adapting multilingual models for this specific linguistic context.",
      "approach": "Built a novel 2,600-article dataset combining native news sources, machine translation, and synthetic data augmentation. Fine-tuned Multilingual BERT with custom preprocessing for Luganda's unique morphological features.",
      "solution": "The final system achieves 85.7% accuracy across 5 news categories (Politics, Sports, Entertainment, Business, Technology). Deployed as a full-stack application with FastAPI backend and Vercel frontend.",
